# WP3: Creative use of AI for health and well-being

*WP Leaders: [Claire Ghetti](https://www.uib.no/en/persons/Claire.Ghetti) (UiB) / [Andreas Bergsland](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/andreas.bergsland) (NTNU) / [Jonna Vuoskoski](https://www.hf.uio.no/imv/english/people/aca/tenured/jonnakv/index.html) (UiO)*

## Overview

This WP investigates how AI-generated creative content (images, music, literature, media, etc.) impacts human health and well-being. It also examines the use of AI in creative arts therapies to promote mental health and physical well-being and how novel health research methods involving AI can enable new knowledge generation.

Engaging in creative processes can promote health and well-being. AI tools offer opportunities for augmenting human creativity, yet their use also raises concerns about the potential devaluation of human qualities like empathy and autonomy. We will explore how AI can both support and create challenges for well-being, creativity, and emotional expression.

Ethical considerations are central to this WP, especially how AI can be used responsibly to avoid reinforcing inequalities or biases. Our approach emphasises anti-oppressive practices and seeks to support historically marginalised groups through inclusive AI applications in the arts. Collaboration with users and stakeholders is key to creating innovative solutions while ensuring health-promoting AI interventions are relevant and ethically sound. Critical disability perspectives are incorporated to ensure that AI systems in arts for health are inclusive and accessible for all.

## Research Questions

- **RQ3.1:** How do humans perceive, experience and relate to AI-generated creative content?
- **RQ3.2:** How can Creative AI systems enhance emotional well-being and facilitate therapeutic outcomes?
- **RQ3.3:** What can AI offer research in mental and physical health that incorporates the creative arts?
- **RQ3.4:** How are aspects of consent, equity and justice safeguarded when AI is integrated into creative processes in health contexts?

## Approaches

- **CREATE:** reflexive and user-informed "failsafe" frameworks and guidelines for disability-inclusive integration of AI into the arts for health and well-being.
- **EXPLORE:** how AI-generated content and interactive AI systems affect human behaviour and emotions.
- **REFLECT:** on the benefits and risks to human health and well-being of integrating AI into creative processes.
