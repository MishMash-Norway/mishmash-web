# WP4: Creative use of AI in education

*WP Leaders: [Eirik Sørbø](https://www.uia.no/english/about-uia/employees/eiriks05/) (UiA) / [Sidsel Karlsen](https://nmh.no/en/contact-us/employees/sidsel-karlsen) (NMH) / [Fredrik Graver](https://www.inn.no/english/find-an-employee/fredrik-graver.html) (INN)*

## Overview

The rapid inclusion of AI into education presents transformative opportunities and challenges for teaching and learning alongside significant pedagogical, ethical and practical issues. This WP explores how education can harness AI to enhance learning opportunities, foster creativity, and support critical thinking and AI literacy. 

The educational sector is currently characterised by numerous local initiatives to adopt commercial AI tools. However, high-quality, open education resources—especially on Creative AI—are scarce, with hardly any available in Norwegian. There is a clear need for a unified effort to advance AI literacy in Norwegian schools and enhance the understanding and application of Creative AI in higher education and lifelong learning.

The aim is to equip future practitioners and educators with the competence to navigate AI's complexities while providing current educators with resources to minimise a generational gap in AI literacy. WP4 will collaborate closely with researchers from other WPs to incorporate insights from ongoing research into educational programs and curricula and to influence technological developments from an educational point of view.

## Research Questions

- **RQ4.1:** How can Creative AI be effectively integrated to enhance teaching and learning and foster human creativity?
- **RQ4.2:** How can the artistic use of AI within creative and fine arts education challenge and develop hierarchies of knowledge production in education and research?
- **RQ4.3:** What measures can ensure that ethical considerations such as diversity, justice, fairness, inclusion, privacy, trust, and accessibility are central to implementing AI in creative education?
- **RQ4.4:** How can the relationship between AI in formalised education and the application of AI in broader artistic practice be mapped and analysed to advance the use of Creative AI?

## Approaches

- **CREATE:** educational material, models and methods for broad applications through artistic and pedagogical practices with AI, emphasising ethical issues related to diversity, justice, fairness, inclusion, privacy, trust and accessibility.
- **EXPLORE:** the artistic and pedagogical use of AI in formal, non-formal and informal learning contexts, including developing a shared understanding of AI literacy for creative and fine arts education.
- **REFLECT:** on the implications of using AI in education to suggest frameworks and policy recommendations for using AI in education.
