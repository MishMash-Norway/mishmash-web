# WP7: Human-centric AI for Creative Problem-Solving

## Overview

This WP explores how a person or group can use Creative AI for task-specific problem-solving. The tasks considered in this WP range from industrial design, where artistic methods are integral to design processes, to emergency rescue scenarios, where imminent problems must be solved by creatively using available resources.

We target creative goal-based practitioners, including professionals as diverse as designers, filmmakers, human operators in industrial settings, and emergency service personnel, and we adopt the principles and ideas of Creative AI that MishMash co-creates through its three perspectives.

To achieve this in a goal-driven context, new frameworks must be developed that give creators freedom, surprise, control, and inspiration and allow them to evaluate, select, discard, and apply AI's contributions. The creative process must be interactive, ranging from iterative prompt-based exploration to real-time collaboration with an embodied AI.

The process should support creators in addressing their professions' requirements and other practical challenges, finding pragmatic solutions instead of circumventing them. A key challenge here is potential conflicts between artistic freedom and the practical requirements that the creator must fulfil.

AIs developed in this WP will be limited by stricter boundaries than others—from the laws of physics to legal frameworks, such as realism constraints. We will go beyond informed AI approaches in our focus on encoding these limitations into the development principles for Creative AIs. WP7 will generate new knowledge of algorithmic, personal and societal challenges when applying Creative AI in creative practices in collaboration with other WPs facilitated by MishMash's cross-cutting perspectives.

## Research Questions

- **RQ7.1:** How can we integrate Creative AI in creative problem-solving processes to maintain and develop human agency, control and personal expressive capabilities?
- **RQ7.2:** How can we use algorithmically emulated empathy to achieve a greater sense of human agency and empowerment for humans?
- **RQ7.3:** How can interfaces for AI and AI-supported services be designed to enhance user experience and transparency, making co-creative processes more accessible?
- **RQ7.4:** To what extent can we personalise and customise Creative AI systems that extend to a wide range of applications and contexts, allowing the definition of generic frameworks?

## Approaches

- **CREATE:** AI algorithms that can empower human creativity in pursuing tasks with external goals while remaining within (learned) bounds regarding physical, legal, emotional, social and other constraints.
- **EXPLORE:** how Creative AI algorithms can empower humans while ensuring their sense of agency and ownership by observing, understanding, and adapting to human expression.
- **REFLECT:** about the perception of creativity in problem-solving, ranging from the ability of an AI system to separate recreation from creativity, the creator's intent, to the perception of a user or an observer of the creation.
