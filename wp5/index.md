# WP5: AI in the Creative and Cultural Industries

*WP Leaders: [Ragnhild Brøvig](https://www.hf.uio.no/imv/english/people/aca/tenured/ragnhiba/index.html) (UiO) / [Irina Eidsvold-Tøien](https://www.bi.no/en/about-bi/employees/department-of-law2/irina-eidsvold-toien/) (BI) / [Jon Marius Aareskjold-Drecker](https://en.uit.no/ansatte/person?p_document_id=93949&p_dimension_id=88175) (UiT)*

## Overview

Technological innovation has consistently disrupted creative industries' business models, revenue streams, and legal frameworks. These disruptions have intensified with the rise of digital platforms, streaming services, and AI technologies. AI's ability to generate cultural content brings new opportunities and significant legal and ethical concerns.

Key issues include copyright, moral rights, and the ethics of training AI on human artists' work, voices, and other bodily expressions without proper agreements. Furthermore, the vast amount of AI-generated content challenges existing revenue-sharing models, requiring a rethinking of traditional frameworks.

However, AI can also offer innovative solutions, such as AI-driven identification systems for rights management. Such systems could help harmonise and complete international databases for ownership and metadata, enhancing transparency and efficiency. AI could also facilitate more equitable distribution of royalties across different regions and sectors.

This WP is dedicated to exploring both the challenges and solutions that AI presents to the legal and structural dynamics of the creative industries by investigating current practices. It also aims to connect this awareness to the research and development carried out throughout the MishMash network and to disseminate knowledge, ethical and legal guidelines, and newly developed tools to various stakeholders. 

As part of this effort, Norinnova, a technology transfer office located in Tromsø, will contribute to identifying and commercialising new tools and solutions developed under the MishMash umbrella. Researchers from NORSUS, the Norwegian Institute for Sustainability Research, will write a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) report to address the environmental impact of new Creative AIs. Furthermore, legal scholars involved in MishMash will share guidelines with legal stakeholders.

## Research Questions

- **RQ5.1:** How does training AI systems on existing artistic expressions and recorded voices raise issues related to privacy, copyright, human rights, private law, and contract law, and what regulatory frameworks are needed to address these legal challenges and guide policy-making?
- **RQ5.2:** What are ethical, environmental, privacy, and safety considerations when training AI models on large datasets for artistic applications, and what strategies can mitigate these concerns effectively?
- **RQ5.3:** How do AI technologies affect the structures of the creative industries, and what business models and regulatory frameworks are needed to accommodate these changes while securing sustained development of ethical practices and human creativity?
- **RQ5.4:** What role can AI play in developing global databases for rights management and ensuring comprehensive and accurate ownership records in the creative industries?

## Approaches

- **CREATE:** academic and cultural awareness through publications and dissemination about the current and future states of affairs, robust infrastructures for data management, recommendations for sustainable business models, and appropriate legislation for handling emerging AI-generated content.
- **EXPLORE:** AI's impact on artists' rights and positions within the cultural industries and develop strategies to balance the economic benefits of AI integration with the need to maintain job opportunities.
- **REFLECT:** on how to maintain and develop culturally and economically sustainable business models, regulatory frameworks, and political strategies to address AI-related challenges.
