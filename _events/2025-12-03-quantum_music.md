An evening exploring music with AI and quantum computing with Eduardo Reck Miranda and Victoria Johnson.

Artificial intelligence is revolutionising music creation and performance. AI-powered tools can now compose, analyse, enhance production quality, and curate personalised playlists, allowing musicians and listeners to explore new horizons. However, the advent of quantum computers promises to push these boundaries even further. Quantum computers leverage phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to perform computations in fundamentally different ways from classical computers. They can explore many possibilities simultaneously, potentially offering exponential speedups for complex computational problems. The basic unit of quantum computation, the _qubit_, differs from a classical _bit_ in that it can exist in a superposition of two states.

Practical quantum computers are still experimental. Building stable, low-error qubits is difficult because of decoherence and noise. There is growing interest in exploring quantum computing for a wide range of tasks. Artistic exploration—including music composition and performance—is a natural part of this exploration. We are fortunate to have quantum computer music pioneer [Eduardo Reck Miranda](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/staff/eduardo-miranda) visiting Oslo to talk about his experiences and play some of his music.
