[Sascha Frühholz](https://www.sv.uio.no/psi/english/people/academic/saschaf/) will present a short lecture on the topic *Human neurocognitive vulnerabilities and resilience against AI deepfake deception*	

## Abstract
Deepfakes are AI-generated instances of human appearance intended to mislead humans into deception. Such deepfakes have many applications in social media and artistic contexts but are also often used for social misconduct or even criminal purposes. Such AI deepfakes exploit human vulnerabilities to deception, since human cognition and neural processing are often lazy and non-deliberate. In this talk, I will give an overview of our recent psychological and neuroscience studies on how much humans can distinguish real from AI deepfake content, with a particular focus on human biometric identity as a major target of criminal deepfake attacks.	

## Bio

[Sascha Frühholz](https://www.sv.uio.no/psi/english/people/academic/saschaf/) is a trained Neuroscientist and Forensic Psychologist. He obtained degrees in Psychology (U Bremen GER, 2006) and Educational Science (U Augsburg GER, 2001). He earned his PhD in neurobiology and neuropsychology (U Bremen GER, 2008). His main research areas are social and affective neuroscience and the influence of digital and AI technologies on human cognition. He is investigating human-human and human-machine interactions in the auditory (voice communication) and visual (facial communication) modalities. He is specifically interested in the affective dimension of such interactions.
