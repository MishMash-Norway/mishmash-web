[Olav Renolen Aasbø](https://nmh.no/kontakt-oss/ansatte/olav-renolen-aasbo) will present a short lecture on the topic *Digitalization (and use of AI) in the music classroom*.

## Abstract
This session presents preliminary findings from an ongoing PhD project at the Norwegian Academy of Music. The project aims to map the degree of digitalization in the music classroom, including what kinds of digital tools are used, for which activities, and how teachers evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of these tools. A questionnaire was completed by 597 teachers, including a dedicated section on the use of AI in music education. This session focuses on results from that section, offering insights into how music teachers report their use of AI, which AI solutions they employ, for what purposes, and how they express their attitudes toward AI as part of music education.
