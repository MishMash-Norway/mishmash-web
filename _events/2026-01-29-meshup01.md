Postdoctoral researcher Benedikte Wallace (UiO) will present a short lecture on the topic *Teaching Machines to Move for Human–AI Interaction*.

## Abstract

This talk looks at why expressive movement matters for human–AI interaction, and how dance performance can serve as a useful testbed. But what happens when the dancer is an AI model, or a robot body that does not move like us? Wallace will present her work on AI-generated dance and how dancers and audiences often find glitches and unexpected movements most interesting, raising questions about the goals of generative models in art. Finally, we will explore how people read intent and emotion from movement, why non-human bodies can still feel expressive, and what challenges remain for responsive, improvising human–robot movement.

## Bio

Benedikte Wallace is a postdoctoral researcher at the RITMO Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies of Rhythm, Time, and Motion at the University of Oslo. With a background in music production and a PhD in Informatics, her academic interests lie in the cross-section between art and science. Her work explores human-AI and human-robot interaction through generative machine learning and the use of AI as a tool for pursuing and understanding creativity.
